My personal website.

I learned how to make a website from [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com). My website still looks a lot like what I made there. However, I rebuilt my website with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev). I am still trying to learn Eleventy. I am also trying to figure out what GitHub does.
