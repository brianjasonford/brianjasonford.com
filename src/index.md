ðŸ‘‹ _Welcome to my website!_

My name is Brian. I made this website because I am curious about how websites work and want the challenge of learning how to make something new. I also like the idea of having a space on the internet that I control directly. I enjoy keyboards, coffee, stories told though all sorts of media, and nerdy games. My plan is to talk about those things here, but first I have to learn how to make this website. 

_I'll learn how to make this webiste by [making this website](/roadmap/)._

I rarely post to social media, but lately I have been enjoying Mastodon and Discord. You can find me on Mastodon here: [@brianjasonford@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@brianjasonford)

There is a reasonable chance that you have found this page by searching for my name. If you did that, you might know me in a professional context. Please note that this is my personal website. **I will never talk about my work here.** Do not concat me about my work through this website or on social media.

<p class="notice">I learned how to make this website with <a href="https://blakewatson.com">Blake Watson's</a> awesome web book <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a>. Then, I changed how this website works and what it can do with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, learning from <a href="https://thinkdobecreate.com">Stephanie Eckles'</a> great <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3">Egghead course</a> and <a href="https://11ty.rocks">11ty Rocks!</a>, the <a href="https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev">Learn Eleventy</a> project, and the examples at <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">11tybundle.dev</a>. The folks at the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/">11ty Discord server</a> have been welcoming and helpful!</p>
