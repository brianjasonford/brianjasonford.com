ðŸ‘‹ _Welcome to my website!_

This website is a learning project for me. I am curious about how websites work, and wanted to figure out if I could make one for myself. I also think it is nice to have a spot online outside of social media â€“ made by me â€“ and under my own control (to the extent possible). [You can help me decide what I should do next!](/roadmap/)

There is a reasonable chance that you have found this page by using my name in a search. And, if you did that, there is a reasonable chance that you know me in a professional context. Please note that this is my personal website. **I will never talk about my work here.**

<p class="notice">I learned how to make this website with <a href="https://blakewatson.com">Blake Watson's</a> awesome web book <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a>. Then, I changed how this website works and what it can do with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, learning much from <a href="https://thinkdobecreate.com">Stephanie Eckles'</a> great <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3">Egghead course</a> and <a href="https://11ty.rocks">11ty Rocks!</a> I also took quite a bit from <a href="https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev">Learn Eleventy</a>.</p>
