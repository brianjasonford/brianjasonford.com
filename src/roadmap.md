Is there a glaring omission in the list below? Is there something fun and cool that I should try? [Let me know on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@brianjasonford) and I'll add it! 

## 📝 To Do 
- Add RSS feed to the blog.
- Limit the number of posts that appear on the blog page, and put the rest in an archive.

## 🤔 Considering
- Using CSS or Sass to make this website look nicer. 
- Making my sporadic, rare social media posts show up here (if possible). Likely not worth the effort.
- Making separate pages for my primary interests (this might be better accomplished through the blog and tags).

## 🚧 In Progress
- Figure out a better way to backup this website and roll back to prior versions when I make mistakes. This is fairly high priority, since I make mistakes often.
    - I am trying to learn about GitHub, we have different definitions of ["get started"](https://support.github.com/get-started).
- Learn about how to go about putting this website online when I add posts or make changes. I suspect that I'm doing it wrong.
    - Eleventy has [documentation about deployment](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/). To understand that documentation, I think I have to learn about [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org).
- Make it so that Eleventy only rebuilds files that have changed, not everything every time. (I'm sure there is a clue on [this page of the 11ty website](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/).)

## ✅ Done
- 2025-02-25: Added tags to blog posts and made auto-updating tag pages. 
- 2025-02-20: Added this roadmap.

## 🛑 Stopped
- 2025-02-25: <s>Get the "slugs" right for blog posts.</s> _Each post's file name results in a decent URL._
