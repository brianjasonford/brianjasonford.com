This page tracks changes I've made to this website and what I would like to do going forward. Is there a glaring omission in the list below? Is there something fun and cool that I should try? [Let me know on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@brianjasonford)! 

## 📝 To Do 
- Limit the number of posts that appear on the blog page, and put the rest in an archive.
- A favicon would be nice.
- Add robots.txt ([if that matters](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/several-ai-companies-said-to-be-ignoring-robots-dot-txt-exclusion-scraping-content-without-permission-report)). 

## 🤔 Considering
- Using CSS or Sass to make this website look nicer. 
- Making my sporadic, rare social media posts show up here (if possible). Likely not worth the effort.
- Something fun with these nifty [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) or [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons!


## 🚧 In Progress
- A light/dark toggle.
- Making separate pages for my primary interests (paused until I have more content).

## ✅ Done
- 2025-03-09: Added an [Atom feed to the blog](https://www.brianjasonford.com/feed.xml).
- 2025-03-07: Revised home page, removed &ldquo;about&rdquo; page.
- 2025-03-07: Using Github for backup. I amabout 87% sure I'm doing that correctly!
- 2025-02-27: Generated SSH keys and added a build script to `package.json` so that only changed files in my output folder go to the server using `rsync`.
- 2025-02-25: Added tags to blog posts and made auto-updating tag pages. 
- 2025-02-20: Added this roadmap.
- 2025-02-20: Checked accessibility with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org).
- 2025-02-20: Re-wrote the website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and put it online.
- 2025-01-04: Finished making a website with [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com) and put it online. 

## 🛑 Stopped
- 2025-02-25: <s>Get the "slugs" right for blog posts.</s> _Each post's file name results in a decent URL._
- 2025-02-27 <s>Make it so that Eleventy only rebuilds files that have changed, not everything every time.</s> [Eleventy's documenation about this](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/) is very good, but I solved the problem by using `rsync` to upload only changed files to the server.
