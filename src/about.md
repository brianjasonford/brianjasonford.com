My name is Brian. I made this website becuase I was courious to learn about how webists work and wanted the challenge of making something new. I enjoy keyboards, coffee, and nerdy games. 

I rarely post to social media, and never post about my work. I enjoy Mastodon, and that's a pretty good way to connect with me:

I have other social media accounts as well. I almost never check them, but they do exist:

You can also find me on Discord, but I don't think you can link to a user profile there.
